# Data and code for Flamholz et al. 2022

This paper is now published as Flamholz, Saccomano, Cash & Newman, "Optical O2 Sensors Also Respond to Redox Active Molecules Commonly Secreted by Bacteria" mBio 2022. https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02076-22

This repository contains all the code and data required to produce the main-text and SI figures in the paper. 

* data/ contains all raw or minimally pre-processed data.
* notebooks/ contains Python Jupyter notebooks for data processing and figures.
* figures/ contains output figures.
* isolates/ contains some metadata about the isolate strains used. 

In the notebooks/ directory, you will find several preprocessing scripts with names beginning with numbers. These should be run before generating figures. Figures are generated by the AllFigures.ipynb notebook. Some of the figures had to be composed in illustrator after being generated in Python, but the relevant Illustrator files are in the figures/ directory.
